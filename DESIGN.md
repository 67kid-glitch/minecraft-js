# GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

## Title
COLLISION: THE GAME FIGHTS BACK

## Core Idea
Multiple game universes collide into one broken reality.
Every character believes this is their game.
The game itself becomes the final antagonist.

## Genre
3D Action / Platformer / Combat / Meta

## Camera
Third-person at all times.
Camera is smooth and normal until the 100% completion boss, where it becomes hostile.

## Structure
- Open-world-ish overworld made of fractured kingdoms
- Worlds do not connect logically
- Travel occurs via events, ships, teleportation, or chaos

## Length
Absurdly long.
Game has a real ending.
Post-game continues forever.
100% completion unlocks secret content and final judgment.

## Tone
Unhinged but intentional.
Chaotic but fun.
Never random for no reason.

## Death
Player cannot die.
On failure, player resets to last save.
Characters remember resets and judge you later.

## Credits
Real credits.
Fully skippable.
No fake names.

## Final Boss
The Game itself.
It cheats.
It breaks worlds mid-fight.
At 100%, the camera becomes a boss.
